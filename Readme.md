# OpenBao Mentee Progress Reports

This repository serves as a log of my journey contributing to OpenBao as a mentee under Alexander Scheel [@cipherboy](https://github.com/cipherboy).

## Progress Report Format

Each report is categorized into four key sections:

| Key  | Value         | Description                                                         |
| :--: |:-------------:| :-----                                                              |
| 📖   | Reading       | Resources read and what was learnt.                                 |
| 🖋️   | Meeting Notes | Key takeaways from meetings and emails.                             |
| 💻   | Contributions | Code written, documentation browsed, issues read, code reviews &c.  |
| 💡   | Reflections   | Open ended.                                                         |
